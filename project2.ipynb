To set up the matrix in the system of equations, the transpose of **P** is calculated and subtracted from the identity matrix **I** of the same dimension. For the sum constraint, a row of ones is added to ensure that the sum of the stationary distribution is equal to 1. The equation is then solved using the least-squares method.\n"
